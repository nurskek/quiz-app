# Quiz App with React and styled-components

Runs from localhost.

Initially, it should have been trivia app like 'who wants to win million', but I learned late that application should have been more complex (misunderstood the notion of trivia).

This app has

in /components:
- App.js (with starting screen)
- QuizScreen.js (either presenting result or question container)
- Question.js (main functions are here: timer, goToNextQuestion, select answer etc.; and the most styled-components implemented here too)
- QuizResult.js (ending screen)

in data:
- questions.json (with 4 questions)
